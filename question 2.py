#Question 2

"""
Write a program that calculates the average score on an exam. Assume we have a small class of only three
students. Assign each studentâ€™s score to variables called student1, student2, and student3 and then use
these variables to find the average score. Assign the average to a variable called average. Print the student
scores and the average score.
The following demonstrates the program output when the students have been assigned scores
of 80.0, 90.0, and 66.5:
Student scores:
80.0
90.0
66.5
Average: 78.83333333333333
"""
print("Student scores:")
student1 = input()
student2 = input()
student3 = input()
average = (float(student1) + float(student2) + float(student3))/3.0
print("Average:", average)
